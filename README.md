# Deep-Learning-for-structure-data

`This repository is having codes which were experimented on "How to use Deep Learning algorithms to solve problems using structured data"`

Below are the areas which are covered here - 
- using Deep Neural Networks for Regression and Classification
- using tensorflow.keras preprocessing layers for structured(tabular) data
- Using Covolutional Neural Networks to solve classification problems using tabular data
- using transfer learning (in context to Deep Neural Networks) for tabular data


Majority of the use cases are relevant to banking and finance domain.
